## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run Afterma on your machine or emulator:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankeetray2/afterma-mobile.git
cd afterma-mobile
```

### 2. Set up local secrets
Copy the example environment configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` in your editor and input your credentials:
```properties
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 3. Open in Android Studio
1. Select **File** → **Open...**
2. Browse to the cloned directory and click **OK**.
3. Allow Gradle to sync and download all dependencies.

### 4. Run the Application
1. Connect a physical Android device or launch an Emulator (running API level 24+).
2. Click the **Run** button (green play icon) or press `Shift + F10` (Windows) / `Control + R` (macOS).

## 🔐 Environment & Secrets Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `.env` file contains your local secrets and api keys. It is listed in `.gitignore` and **must never be committed to source control**.

At build-time, the [Secrets Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/google/secrets-gradle-plugin) automatically parses `.env` and generates the corresponding `BuildConfig` fields, exposing them safely to the Kotlin codebase.

| Variable | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Debug & Release | Required for utilizing all generative AI features (Afterma AI chat). |
| `KEYSTORE_FILE` | Release Only | Path to your signing keystore (e.g., `my-upload-key.jks`). |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Release Only | Password of the release keystore. |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | Release Only | Alias name inside the release keystore. |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Release Only | Password of the release key. |

---

## 📦 Building the App

Use the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`) to build the application from the CLI:

```bash
# Clean the project build directories
./gradlew clean

# Build the Debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build the Release APK (requires signing credentials configured in .env)
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install the Debug build onto a connected device or emulator
./gradlew installDebug
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Afterma uses a robust testing setup that includes both unit tests and screenshot visual regression tests.

```bash
# Run all Local JVM Unit Tests
./gradlew test

# Verify visual layout against baseline screenshots (Roborazzi)
./gradlew verifyRoborazziDebug

# Record and update baseline screenshots (run when UI components change intentionally)
./gradlew recordRoborazziDebug
```
